It provides a rich set of features, including adaptive time-stepping, several hydrodynamic schemes, magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, particles, star formation, chemistry, and radiative processes with grackle, data analysis with yt, and memory pool for efficient object allocation. gamer-2 is fully bitwise reproducible. For the performance optimization, it adopts hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization and utilizes overlapping CPU computation, GPU computation, and CPU–GPU communication. Load balancing is achieved using a Hilbert space-filling curve on a level-by-level basis without the need to duplicate the entire AMR hierarchy on each MPI process. To provide convincing demonstrations of the accuracy and performance of gamer-2, we directly compare with enzo on isolated disc galaxy simulations and with flash on galaxy cluster merger simulations. We show that the physical results obtained by different codes are in very good agreement, and gamer-2 outperforms enzo and flash by nearly one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, on the Blue Waters supercomputers using 1–256 nodes. More importantly, gamer-2 exhibits similar or even better parallel scalability compared to the other two codes. We also demonstrate good weak and strong scaling using up to 4096 GPUs and 65 536 CPU cores, and achieve a uniform resolution as high as \\$10\\, 240^3\\$ cells. Furthermore, gamer-2 can be adopted as an AMR + GPUs framework and has been extensively used for the wave dark matter simulations. gamer-2 is open source (available at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer) and new contributions are welcome.}",

  abstract  = {We present the newly developed code, GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement code (GAMER), which adopts a novel approach in improving the performance of adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) astrophysical simulations by a large factor with the use of the graphic processing unit (GPU). The AMR implementation is based on a hierarchy of grid patches with an oct-tree data structure. We adopt a three-dimensional relaxing total variation diminishing scheme for the hydrodynamic solver and a multi-level relaxation scheme for the Poisson solver. Both solvers have been implemented in GPU, by which hundreds of patches can be advanced in parallel. The computational overhead associated with the data transfer between the CPU and GPU is carefully reduced by utilizing the capability of asynchronous memory copies in GPU, and the computing time of the ghost-zone values for each patch is diminished by overlapping it with the GPU computations. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code by performing several standard test problems in astrophysics. GAMER is a parallel code that can be run in a multi-GPU cluster system. We measure the performance of the code by performing purely baryonic cosmological simulations in different hardware implementations, in which detailed timing analyses provide comparison between the computations with and without GPU(s) acceleration. Maximum speed-up factors of 12.19 and 10.47 are demonstrated using one GPU with 40963 effective resolution and 16 GPUs with 81923 effective resolution, respectively.},

	abstract = {The Milky Way's million degree gaseous halo contains a considerable amount of mass that, depending on its structural properties, can be a significant mass component. In order to analyze the structure of the Galactic halo, we use XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer archival data and measure O vii Kα absorption-line strengths toward 26 active galactic nuclei, LMC X-3, and two Galactic sources (4U 1820-30 and X1735-444). We assume a β-model as the underlying gas density profile and find best-fit parameters of n○ = 0.46 cm−3, rc = 0.35 kpc, and β = 0.71. These parameters result in halo masses ranging between M(18 kpc) = 7.5 and M(200 kpc) = 3.8 assuming a gas metallicity of Z = 0.3 Z☉, which are consistent with current theoretical and observational work. The maximum baryon fraction from our halo model of fb = 0.07 is significantly smaller than the universal value of fb = 0.171, implying the mass contained in the Galactic halo accounts for 10%–50% of the missing baryons in the Milky Way. We also discuss our model in the context of several Milky Way observables, including ram pressure stripping in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the observed X-ray emission measure in the 0.5–2 keV band, the Milky Way's star formation rate, spatial and thermal properties of cooler gas (∼105 K), and the observed Fermi bubbles toward the Galactic center. Although the metallicity of the halo gas is a large uncertainty in our analysis, we place a lower limit on the halo gas between the Sun and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that Z ≳ 0.2 Z☉ based on the pulsar dispersion measure toward the LMC.}

	abstract = {We study the spectral and morphological characteristics of the diffuse Galactic emission in the WMAP temperature data using a template-based multilinear regression, and obtain the following results. (1) We confirm previous observations of a bump in the dust-correlated spectrum, consistent with the Draine & Lazarian spinning dust model. (2) We also confirm the “haze” signal in the inner Galaxy, and argue that it does not follow a free-free spectrum as first thought, but instead is synchrotron emission from a hard electron cosmic-ray population. (3) In a departure from previous work, we allow the spectrum of Hα-correlated emission (which is used to trace the free-free component) to float in the fit, and find that it does not follow the expected free-free spectrum. Instead there is a bump near 50 GHz, modifying the spectrum at the 20% level, which we speculate is caused by spinning dust in the warm ionized medium. (4) The derived cross-correlation spectra are not sensitive to the map zero points, but are sensitive to the choice of CMB estimator. In cases where the CMB estimator is derived by minimizing variance of a linear combination of the WMAP bands, we show that a bias proportional to the cross-correlation of each template and the true CMB is always present. This bias can be larger than any of the foreground signals in some bands. (5) Lastly, we consider the frequency coverage and sensitivity of the Planck mission, and suggest linear combination coefficients for the CMB template that will reduce both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the synchrotron and haze spectra by more than an order of magnitude.}

    abstract = { We survey the theory and experimental tests for the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy up to energies of 1015 eV. A guide to the previous reviews and essential literature is given, followed by an exposition of basic principles. The basic ideas of cosmic-ray propagation are described, and the physical origin of its processes is explained. The various techniques for computing the observational consequences of the theory are described and contrasted. These include analytical and numerical techniques. We present the comparison of models with data, including direct and indirect—especially γ-ray—observations, and indicate what we can learn about cosmic-ray propagation. Some important topics, including electron and antiparticle propagation, are chosen for discussion. }

title={A lower limit of 50 microgauss for the magnetic field near the Galactic Centre},

day={01},
volume={463},
number={7277},
pages={65-67},
abstract={There is ample evidence of a magnetic field near the centre of our Galaxy, but much uncertainty as to its strength. Estimates vary from the microgauss to the milligauss range --- and values as great as 1,000 microgauss, about 10,000 times stronger than typical for the bulk of the Galaxy, have been reported. A new analysis of published radio and $\gamma$-ray data reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum that suggests a Galactic Centre magnetic field of 50 microgauss or more. Taken with other evidence, the authors conclude that a field strength of about 100 microgauss is probable, on a par with that found in the inner regions of starburst galaxies.},
