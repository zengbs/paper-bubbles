    abstract = "{We present gamer-2, a GPU-accelerated adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code for astrophysics. It provides a rich set of features, including adaptive time-stepping, several hydrodynamic schemes, magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, particles, star formation, chemistry, and radiative processes with grackle, data analysis with yt, and memory pool for efficient object allocation. gamer-2 is fully bitwise reproducible. For the performance optimization, it adopts hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization and utilizes overlapping CPU computation, GPU computation, and CPU–GPU communication. Load balancing is achieved using a Hilbert space-filling curve on a level-by-level basis without the need to duplicate the entire AMR hierarchy on each MPI process. To provide convincing demonstrations of the accuracy and performance of gamer-2, we directly compare with enzo on isolated disc galaxy simulations and with flash on galaxy cluster merger simulations. We show that the physical results obtained by different codes are in very good agreement, and gamer-2 outperforms enzo and flash by nearly one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, on the Blue Waters supercomputers using 1–256 nodes. More importantly, gamer-2 exhibits similar or even better parallel scalability compared to the other two codes. We also demonstrate good weak and strong scaling using up to 4096 GPUs and 65 536 CPU cores, and achieve a uniform resolution as high as \\$10\\, 240^3\\$ cells. Furthermore, gamer-2 can be adopted as an AMR + GPUs framework and has been extensively used for the wave dark matter simulations. gamer-2 is open source (available at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer) and new contributions are welcome.}",

  abstract  = {We present the newly developed code, GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement code (GAMER), which adopts a novel approach in improving the performance of adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) astrophysical simulations by a large factor with the use of the graphic processing unit (GPU). The AMR implementation is based on a hierarchy of grid patches with an oct-tree data structure. We adopt a three-dimensional relaxing total variation diminishing scheme for the hydrodynamic solver and a multi-level relaxation scheme for the Poisson solver. Both solvers have been implemented in GPU, by which hundreds of patches can be advanced in parallel. The computational overhead associated with the data transfer between the CPU and GPU is carefully reduced by utilizing the capability of asynchronous memory copies in GPU, and the computing time of the ghost-zone values for each patch is diminished by overlapping it with the GPU computations. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code by performing several standard test problems in astrophysics. GAMER is a parallel code that can be run in a multi-GPU cluster system. We measure the performance of the code by performing purely baryonic cosmological simulations in different hardware implementations, in which detailed timing analyses provide comparison between the computations with and without GPU(s) acceleration. Maximum speed-up factors of 12.19 and 10.47 are demonstrated using one GPU with 40963 effective resolution and 16 GPUs with 81923 effective resolution, respectively.},
