1. Explain the jet source parameters
2. Explain the most inner bubbles ( reverse shock )
3. Explain the injection time
4. Making the time serious of close-up view of inner region,
   and explain (1) the formation of inner bubbles (2) how disk let jet be vertical
5. Making Gamma-ray spectrum
5. How to explain
6. Random seed and jet angle is little effect
* The gradient of pressure along z-axis plays an important role to stretch the bubbles.
* The heavy disk causes the inclined jets to form vertical bubbles.
* What is the Mach number of the shock ?
  --> First, we assumed a Mach number of the shock of M ≈ 1.5,
      as follows from the Rankine–Hugoniot condition for the temperature increase from about
      0.2 keV outside the bubbles to around 0.3 keV inside.
* Predict inner bubbles , emitting OIII or OII spectrum.
* How to explain the lifespan of bubbles is too long.

Rule out the hadronic process.
How to explain why we assume e\_CR << e\_gas
