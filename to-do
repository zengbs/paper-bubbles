1. Explain the jet source parameters
2. Explain the most inner bubbles ( reverse shock )
3. Explain the injection time
4. Predict inner bubbles, emitting OIII or OII spectrum.
5. How to explain the lifespan of bubbles is too long.


* What is the Mach number of the shock ?
  --> First, we assumed a Mach number of the shock of M ≈ 1.5,
      as follows from the Rankine–Hugoniot condition for the temperature increase from about
      0.2 keV outside the bubbles to around 0.3 keV inside.
