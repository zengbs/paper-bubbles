\section{Introduction}
The detection of the \textit{Fermi} bubbles \citep{Su2012,Ackermann2014,Narayanan2017},\
two large bubbles symmetrically extending about 50 degrees above and below the Galactic plane,
is one of the great discoveries made with \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope \citep{Atwood2009}.

The gamma-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles is observed in the energy range\
of $1\lesssim E_{\gamma} \lesssim 100$ GeV and has an almost spatially uniform hard\
spectrum, sharp edges and an approximately flat brightness distribution.\

Over the course of a decade,\
the first all-sky X-ray survey with high-spatial resolution \citep{Predehl2021}\
from eROSITA \citep{Predehl2020} also reveals\
a giant hourglass-shaped structure (eROSITA bubbles hereafter) at the GC,\
but extending about twice as large as the Fermi bubbles.\
The large-scale X-ray structure\
shows that the intrinsic size of the bubbles is 14 kiloparsecs across \citep{Predehl2021},
and displays morphological symmetry about the Galactic plane as the Fermi bubbles.

Their symmetry about the GC suggests that they originate\
from powerful energy injections from the GC, possibly related to nuclear star formation\
\citep{PhysRevLett.106.101102,Carretti2013}
or past active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity \citep{Guo2012,Yang2017}.

Early attempts \citep{Sarkar2015,Yang2017,Zhang2020}\
to model the symmetric Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (collectively we call the Galactic bubbles)\
assumed that the jet is vertical to the Galactic plane. However,\
observation \citep{Gallimore2006} has proposed that\
there is a lack of preferred orientation of jets with respect to a disc normal.\
In contrast, a number of galaxies in which the jets are tilted to the disc normal\
(e.g. NGC 3079, \citealt{Cecil2001}; NGC 1052, \citealt{Dopita2015}),\
including galaxies in which the jets lie in the plane of the disc (e.g. IC 5063, \citealt{Morganti2015}).

To this end, this work introduces a dense thin disc of interstellar medium\
around a jet source to deflects and decelerates the jets,\
in an attempt to remedy the symmetry problem of the Galactic bubbles.\

The main purpose of this study is to use three-dimensional\
special relativistic hydrodynamics simulations\
involving CR jet injections from the central SMBH in the Galaxy to investigate\
whether the \textit{inclined} jet scenario is able to produce\
the \textit{symmetric} Galactic bubbles that are\
consistent with the observed features, including the shape, the\
surface brightness (for eROSITA bubbles), and the spectra (for \textit{Fermi} bubbles).\

This paper is organized as follows.\
In Section \ref{Methodology}, we describe the numerical techniques and initial conditions employed.\
We directly compare the morphology of the Galactic bubbles with observation,\
and also show the simulated gamma-ray and microwave spectra compared with observations\
in Section \ref{Results}.
Finally, we summarize our findings in Section \ref{Conclusions}.

\section{Methodology}
\label{Methodology}
  We used the GPU-accelerated special relativistic hydrodynamics AMR code (\textsc{gamer-sr}) developed at the\
  National Taiwan University\
  (Schive et al. \citeyear{gamer-1}, \citeyear{gamer-2}; \citeauthor{tseng2021} \citeyear{tseng2021})\
  to carry out the simulations of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles by CR and relativistic fluid injections from the GC.

  The CRs are advected with the thermal gas, and in return the velocities of gas\
  can react to the gradients of the CR pressure via the source term\
  containing spatial divergence of fluid velocities.\

  Although the high-energy CRe ($10$ --- $100$ GeV) plays a crucial role in reproducing the $\gamma$-ray map\
  within the range of $1$ --- $100$ GeV, we assume the pressure of CRe is much less than that of gas\
  throughout the simulation so that we , and the Fermi bubbles can be outlined against the eROSITA bubbles.

  As stressed by \citet{Yang2012}, CR diffusion has an insignificant effect on the overall morphology of the Fermi bubbles,\
  but only sharpens the edges of the simulated bubbles by the interplay between anisotropic CR diffusion\
  and magnetic fields with suppressed perpendicular diffusion across the bubble surface. Moreover,\
  the bubbles should be weak due to adiabatic expansion, and thus the magnetic fields has\
  a little effect on the overall dynamics. For these two reasons,\
  we have ignored the CR diffusion and the magnetic field throughout\
  the simulation.

  We do not simulate the spectral evolution of the CR, and we neglected the cooling and heating processes of CRs,\
  such as energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, and reacceleration in shocks.\

  In this approach, we treat CRs as a single species without distinction between electrons and protons,\
  that cannot react to the gas via the application of CRe pressure,\
  and solve directly for the evolution of CR energy density $e_{\text{cr}}$\
  as a function of $\mathbf{r}$ and $t$.\

  Since the relativistic fluid ejected by the jet source\
  is quickly stalled off and slowed down by a dense ISM disc in a short time,\
  and the relativistic fluid\
  accounts for a little minority of total mass inside the simulation box,\
  we still use the Newtonian gravity to attack this problem.

  The governing equations solving the special relativistic ideal fluid\
  including CR advection, and dynamical coupling between the thermal gas and CRs without CR diffusion\
  can be written a succinct form as


  \begin{subequations}
    \label{governing-eq}
    \begin{align}
     &\partial_{t} D+\partial_{j} \left(DU^{j}/\gamma\right)=0,\label{D evolution}\\
     &\partial_{t} M^{i}+\partial_{j} \left(M^{i}U^{j}/\gamma+p_{\text{gas}}\delta^{ij}\right)=\
     -\rho\partial_{i}\Phi,\label{M evolution}\\
     &\partial_{t} \tilde{E}+\partial_j \left[\left(\tilde{E}+p_{\text{gas}}\right)U^{j}/\gamma\right]=0, \label{E evoltion}\\
     &\partial_{t} \left(\gamma e_{\text{cr}}\right) + \partial_{j} \left(e_{\text{cr}}U^{j}\right)=\
     -p_{\text{cr}} \partial_{j} U^{j},\label{D evolution}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}


  where the five conserved quantities of gas $D$, $M^{i}$, and $\tilde{E}$ are the mass density,\
  the momentum densities, and the reduced energy density, respectively.\
  The reduced energy density is defined by subtracting the rest mass energy density of gas\
  from the total energy density of gas.\
  $\gamma$ and $U^{j}$ are the temporal and spatial component of four-velocity of gas.\
  $\rho$ is the gas density in the local rest frame defined by $D/\gamma$.\
  $p_{\text{gas}}$ is the gas pressure.\
  $p_{\text{cr}}$ and $e_{\text{cr}}$ are the CR pressure and CR energy density measured in the local rest frame.\
  $\Phi$ is the gravitation potential.\
  $c$ is the speed of light, and $\delta^{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta notation.\
  Throughout this paper, Latin indices run from 1 to 3, except when stated otherwise.\

  The set of \Cref{governing-eq} is closed by using the Taub-Mathews equation of state \citep{Taub,TM_EOS}\
  that approximates the exact EoS \citep{Synge} for ultra-relativistically\
  hot gases coexisting with non-relativistically cold gases.

  \textsc{gamer-sr} adopts a new algorithm \citep{tseng2021} to convert between\
  primitive ($\rho$, $U^{j}$, $p$) and conserved variables ($D$, $M^{j}$, $\tilde{E}$),\
  significantly reducing numerical error caused by catastrophic cancellations\
  that commonly occur within the regions with high Mach number flows. e.g., jet-ISM interaction zones.

  \textsc{gamer-sr} also adaptively and locally reduce the min-mod coefficient\
  \citep{tseng2021} within the failed patch group.\
  Doing so provides an elegant way to avoid the use of pressure/density floor,\
  being unnatural but widely used in almost publicly available codes.\

  \subsection{The Galactic and Disk Models}
  As a proof-of-concept study, we approximate conventionally axisymmetric stellar potential of Milky Way\
  by a plane-parallel potential that is symmetric about the mid-plane $z=0$\
  in a simulation box size of\
  $14\times14\times28$ kpc, slightly larger than the size of eROISTA bubbles.

  The plane-parallel potential is fixed throughout our simulations and given by
  \begin{equation}
    \Phi_{\text{total}}(z) = \Phi_{\text{bulge}}(z) + \Phi_{\text{halo}}(z),
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{equation}
    \Phi_{\text{bulge}}(z)=\
    2\sigma^2_{\text{bulge}}\
    \ln\cosh\left(z\sqrt{\frac{2\pi G\rho_{\text{bulge}}^{\text{peak}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{bulge}}}}\right)
  \end{equation}
  is the potential of an isothermal slab mainly contributed by stars around the Galactic bulge, and\
  $\Phi_{\text{halo}}(z)=v^2_{\text{halo}}\ln\left(z^2+d^2_{\text{h}}\right)$\
  is a plane-parallel dark logarithmic halo potential.

  With the help of the isothermal and hydrostatic equilibrium conditions,\
  and assuming the interfaces between isothermal disc and atmosphere are in thermal pressure equilibrium,\
  we can write the steady-state gaseous density distributions,\
  confined in the total potential, of the disc and the Galactic atmosphere as\
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
     \displaystyle \rho_{\text{isoDisk}}(z) = \rho_{\text{isoDisk}}^{\text{peak}}
     \exp\left[-\frac{\Phi_{\text{total}}(z)}{k_{B}T_{\text{isoDisk}}/m_{\text{p}}}\right]&\label{isothermal-disc-density}\\
     \text{, if $|z| < z_{0}$}& \nonumber \\
     \nonumber\\
     \displaystyle \rho_{\text{atmp}}(z) = \rho_{\text{atmp}}^{\text{peak}}
     \exp\left[-\frac{\Phi_{\text{total}}(z)}{k_{B}T_{\text{atmp}}/m_{\text{p}}}\right]&\label{isothermal-atmp-density}\\
     \text{, otherwise,}& \nonumber
  \end{align}
  \label{disc-atm-sys}
  \end{subequations}
  where $m_{\text{p}}$ is the proton mass,\
  $T_{\text{isoDisk}}$ and $T_{\text{atmp}}$ is the temperature of the isothermal disc and atmosphere,\
  $\rho_{\text{isoDisk}}^{\text{peak}}$ and $\rho_{\text{atmp}}^{\text{peak}}$ is the peak mass density\
  of the disc and atmosphere on the mid-plane $z=0$.

  We tabulate parameters in the first four\
  categories of \Cref{table-parameters},\
  except for $\rho_{\text{atmp}}^{\text{peak}}$ that\
  can be derived from the other known parameters and thermal pressure equilibrium condition\
  on the interfaces $(z=\pm z_{0})$ between the disc and atmosphere.\

  The density profile of \Cref{disc-atm-sys} is shown in \Cref{fig__initial-density-profile}.\
  Beyond the core radius ($\sim 2 \text{ kpc}$) the gaseous density decreases rapidly as a power-law.

%  The density profile of \Cref{disc-atm-sys} is shown in \Cref{fig__initial-density-profile}\
%  and compared to the observed result \citep{Miller_2013} beyond 1 kpc.\
%
%  Note that there is an difficulty in disentangling the contribution\
%  of the Local Bubble, a supernova remnant in which the Solar System is embedded \citep{Snowden1990},\
%  and the contribution from solar wind charge-exchange processes, which produce soft\
%  X-ray emission throughout the Solar System. As a result, the density profile of the Galactic halo remains unclear\
%  \citep{BlandHawthorn2016}.

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig__initial-density-profile.png}
    \caption{The density profile of the isothermal disc (red pluses) and\
             atmosphere (blue crosses) along the positive z-axis.\
             The density distribution is derived from hydrostatic equilibrium,\
             the interface ($z=0.1$) between the isothermal disc\
             and the atmosphere is pressure balanced.}
    \label{fig__initial-density-profile}
  \end{figure}



  To quantify the synchrotron radiation as a function of position, it\
  is essential to start the simulation with a more realistic magnetic\
  field distribution. To this end, for our fixed magnetic field we adopt\
  the default exponential model in \textsc{galprop} \citep{Strong2007}
  which has the following spatial dependence:\

  \begin{equation}
     |\mathbf{B}(R, z)|=B_{0}\exp{-z/z_{0}}\exp{-R/R_{0}},
  \end{equation}


  where $R=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, $B_{0}$ is the average field strength at the GC\
  and $z_{0}$ and $R_{0}$ are the characteristic scales in the vertical and radial\
  directions, respectively. We adopt $z_{0} = 2$ kpc and $R_{0} = 10$ kpc, which\
  are best-fitting values in the \textsc{galprop} model to reproduce the\
  observed large-scale 408 MHz synchrotron radiation in the Galaxy.\
  We choose $B_{0} = 50$ $\mu$G based on the observed field strength at the\
  GC \citep{Crocker2010}.

  \subsection{The Clumpy Multiphase Interstellar Medium}

  A crucial component in our work is the clumpy ISM disc initialized by\
  the publicly available pyFC code
  \footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFC}}.\

  pyFC randomly generates dimensionless 3D scalar field $f(\bold{x})$\ % that is clumpy and porous.
  that obeys the log-normal probability distribution\
  with mean $\mu$ and dispersion $\sigma$,\
  and follows the power-law Kolmogorov spectrum
  \begin{equation}
    D(\bold{k})=\int k^{2} \hat{f}(\bold{k})\hat{f}^{*}(\bold{k})d\Omega \propto k^{-\beta},
    \label{Kolmogorov-spectrum}
  \end{equation}
  where $\hat{f}(\bold{k})$ is the Fourier transform of $f(\bold{x})$.\
  The spectrum $D(\bold{k})$ in the Fourier space is characterized by the power law index $\beta=5/3$,\
  the Nyquist limit $k_{\text{max}}$, and the lower cutoff wave number $k_{\text{min}}$.
  $k_{\text{max}}$ is one-half of the spatial resolution within disc,\
  and $k_{\text{min}}$ is 375.0, corresponding to the maximum size of an individual clump $\sim 20$ pc.\
  \citet{LA2002} and \citet{Wagner2012} have outlined a detailed procedure\
  for constructing a clumpy scalar field, and we do not repeat here.

  The density of clumpy disc can thus be obtained by taking the scalar products of\
  $f(\bold{x})$ with $\rho_{\text{isoDisk}}(z)$ over all cells within the disc, i.e.,\
  $\displaystyle\rho_{\text{ismDisk}}(\bold{x}) =\
  f(\bold{x}) \rho_{\text{isoDisk}}(z)$.\
  Also, the thermal pressure equilibrium within the clumpy disc implies that the temperature of disc is
  $\displaystyle T_{\text{ismDisk}}(\bold{x}) =\
  T_{\text{isoDisk}}(z)\rho_{\text{isoDisk}}(z)/\rho_{\text{ismDisk}}(\bold{x})$.


  \Cref{table-parameters} summarize the parameters of the clumpy disc and their references.

  On the basis of this setup, we cover the AMR base level with\
  $16\times16\times32$ root cells, refined progressively on the mid-plane $z=0$\
  based on the gradient of mass density.\
  We also restrict the refinement level at 7 within the cold disc so that\
  a molecular cloud can be adequately resolved by approximately 30 cells along their diameter, 20 pc.

  \Cref{fig__zoom-in-disc} shows a close-up view of the\
  pressure, temperature, and number density slices
  in the y-z plane through the center of the disc.

  \Cref{fig__numberDensityHistogram} plots the volume filling factor as a function of\
  initial number density within the disc without jet source.\

\subsection{Inclined jet injection}

  Motivated by these observations, we simulate the jet with an inclination angle\
  $45^{\circ}$ with respect to the Galactic plane\
  in order to release the caveat that\
  the jet direction must be perpendicular to the Galactic plane, and in particular to\
  investigate the effect of the jet-disc misalignment on the symmetry of bubbles.


  A few additional quantities are used to characterize the jets:
  the density contrast between the thermal gas contained in the jet source and the ambient gas,\
  $\rho_{\text{jet}}/\rho_{\text{amb}}=10^{-3}$,\
  the temperature contrast, $T_{\text{jet}}/T_{\text{amb}}=2\times10^{4}$,\
  the pressure ratio of CR to gas is 0.18,\
  and the flow 4-velocity inside the jet source $\beta\gamma = 0.6$\
  along the symmetric axis of cylinder.\
  The jet power is thus $3.2\times 10^{42}$ erg/s, resulting in the Eddington ratio 0.008.

  Note that as we inject the jets at the center of the clumpy disc,\
  we define the ambient gas density by the peak density of\
  the isothermal disc on the mid-plane $z=0$ (i.e. $\rho^{\text{peak}}_{\text{isoDisk}}$),\
  as opposed to the \textit{clumpy} density around the jet source, to avoid ambiguous definition.


  The bipolar jets are constantly ejected from a cylindrical source within a jet duration time 1.2 Myr,\
  allowing the total ejected energy $1.2\times10^{56}$ erg is between\
  $8\times10^{55}$ erg and $1.3\times10^{56}$ erg, estimated by \citet{Predehl2020}.\


  The diameter and height of cylindrical source are 4 pc, leading to the source volume $\sim 50 \text{ pc}^{3}$ is\
  much smaller than that of an individual clump by a factor of about 83.\
  By intentionally reducing the volume ratio of the jet source to an individual clump,\
  we can mitigate the effect of the randomness of the clumps on the bubbles.\
  Moreover, we resolve the jet source with the highest refinement level 11,\
  bringing the finest spatial resolution up to 0.4 pc.\

             shows that the initial density distribution of the dense disc has an insignificant effect\
             on the overall dynamics of bubbles. However, the outer bubbles with the smooth disc\
             in an uniform atmosphere (third) is spherical-shape,\
             suggesting the stratification facilitates the outer bubbles elongation significantly.\
             Also, the first three and the rightmost columns show that the most inner bubbles (dashed box)\
             can only appear associated with the disc, and without the disc, the outer bubbles will be tilted,
             indicating the dense disc is crucial for\
             the axis-symmetrically outer bubbles and of the most inner bubbles formation.

\subsection{X-ray emission}


Thermal bremsstrahlung: The X-ray emissivity in an energy range 1.4–1.6 keV is calculated\
using the MEKAL model \citep{Xray-1,Xray-2,Xray-3}\
implemented in the utility XSPEC \citep{XSPEC}, assuming solar metallicity.\

Note that the observed X-ray emission is contributed by all the gas in the Milky Way halo,\
which likely extends to a radius of $\sim$250 kpc \citep{halo-radius-1,halo-radius-2},\
much bigger than our simulation box. Therefore, we first compute the X-ray emissivity\
from the simulated gas within a radius of 25 kpc away from the GC.
Then, beyond 25 kpc the gas is assumed to be isothermal with $T=10^6$ K and\
follows out to a radius of 250 kpc the observed density profile of \citep{temperature-MW}.

  \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Leptonic process}
In the leptonic scenario, the gamma-rays originate from IC scattering of the ISRF by CRe.\
The CRe spectrum follows a power law distribution\
with a spectral index $p=2.4$ and ranges from\
$m_{\text{e}}c^2$ ($0.5$ MeV) to $1.1\times10^{6}m_{\text{e}}c^2$ ($550$ GeV).\


The emissivity of the upscattered photons at the energy $\epsilon_{1}$ is given by\
the double integrals \citep{BLUMENTHAL1970}\
over the range of incident photon energy and the CRe Lorentz factor:

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
  &\frac{dE}{dtd\epsilon_{1}dV} =\nonumber\\
               &\frac{3}{4}\sigma_{T}c\mathbb{C}\epsilon_{1}\int^{\epsilon_{\text{max}}}_{\epsilon_{\text{min}}}
               \frac{n(\epsilon)}{\epsilon}d\epsilon\int^{\gamma_{\text{max}}}_{\gamma_{\text{min}}\left(\epsilon\right)}
               \gamma^{-(p+2)}f(q, \Gamma)d\gamma,\\
  \nonumber\\
  &f(q, \Gamma) =\nonumber\\
               &2q\ln q+(1+2q)(1-q)+0.5(1-q)\frac{\left(\Gamma q\right)^2}{1+\Gamma q},\\
  &q=\frac{\epsilon_{1}/\gamma\
               m_{\text{e}}c^{2}}{\Gamma\left(1-\epsilon_{1}/\gamma m_{\text{e}}c^{2}\right)},\\
  &\Gamma=\frac{4\epsilon \gamma}{m_{\text{e}}c^2},\\
  &\gamma_{\text{min}}(\epsilon)=\
   0.5\left(\frac{\epsilon_{1}}{m_{\text{e}}c^2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\epsilon_{1}}{m_{\text{e}}c^2}\right)^2+\
   \frac{\epsilon_{1}}{\epsilon}}\right),
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $\sigma_{T}$ is the Thomson cross section, $c$ speed of light, $m_{\text{e}}$ electron mass,\
$n(\epsilon)$ the photon number density of ISRF per energy, $\gamma$ the Lorentz factor of CRe,\
$\mathbb{C}$ and $p$ are the normalization constant and spectral index of CRe power-law spectrum,\
$\gamma_{\text{min}}(\epsilon)$ is the minimum required Lorentz factor of CRe such that CRe is energetic sufficient for\
producing scattered photon at the energy $\epsilon_{1}$ from an incident photon energy $\epsilon$.\
$\gamma_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum CRe Lorentz factor in the spectrum, i.e. $\gamma_{\text{max}}=10^{6}$.


We integrate the incident photon energy from\
$\epsilon_{\text{min}}=1.13\times10^{-4}$ eV (CMB radiation) to\
$\epsilon_{\text{max}}=13.59$ eV (starlight) in order to\
facilitate a reliable interpretation of simulated gamma-ray map.


The gamma-ray emissivity\
is computed for each computational cell in our simulations\
using the Klein–Nishina IC cross-section \citep{Jones1968} based\
on the simulated CR number density and the ISRF model given by \citet{Porter2017}.


To evaluate the simulated photon flux $I$ at the energy $\epsilon_{1}$ and\
take into account the perspective projection effect,
we integrate the emissivity over line-of-sights from the solar position at $(x,y,z)=(8,0,0)$ kpc:
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}}\int \frac{dE}{dtd\epsilon_{1}dV} dl.
\end{equation}

           algorithm \citep{Selig2015} that analyzes\
           the photon data from the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope \citep{Atwood2009}\
           and removes the contribution from point-like component.

%\subsubsection{Hadronic process}
%In the hadronic model, CRp undergo hadronic collisions with thermal gas protons\
%and produce $\gamma$-ray via pion decay. The volume emissivity of the emission can be written as
%\begin{equation}
%   \epsilon \propto U_{\text{CRp}}n_{p}\sigma_{p}\kappa_{pp}.
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \frac{dE}{dtd\epsilon_{1}dV} =\

%   \int_{0}^{1}\sigma(\epsilon_{\text{p}}) F(x,\epsilon_{\text{p}}) x^{p}dx.
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\sigma(\epsilon_{\text{p}})=34.3+1.88L+0.25L^{2}\left[1-\frac{E_{\text{threshold}}}{E_{\text{p}}}\right]^{4} \text{ mb}.

%$x=\epsilon_{1}/\epsilon_{\text{p}}$, $B=1.30+0.14L+0.011L^2$, $\beta=\left(1.79+0.11L+0.008L^{2}\right)^{-1}$,\
%$\left(0.801+0.049L+0.014L^{2}\right)^{-1}$, $L=\ln(\epsilon_{\text{p}}/1 \text{ TeV})$.



\section{Conclusions}
\label{Conclusions}
We have found qualitative similarities between the results our simulations\
and the observed spectrum and morphological structure of the Galactic bubbles.


Since the jets encounter a larger column depth of cloudsalong their path,\
they interact more strongly with the dense ISM.\
The jets do not immediately clear a channel along the inclined axis of launch.\
Rather, the dense clouds deflect the jets, which then decelerate\
and launch a sub-relativistic outflow along the minor axis following the path of least resistance.
